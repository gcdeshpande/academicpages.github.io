## Inventing Curriculum using Pointer-Generator Network 
*Supported by Google Cloud under GCP Research Credits Program \
Grant: $5000 Cloud credits \
Role: Principal Investigator
Implementation Language: Python*

Description: The curriculum in general and undergraduate curriculum, in particular, is one of the most important pillars of an education system. The undergraduate curriculum has two main objectives i.e. employability and higher education. The greatest challenge in designing an undergraduate curriculum is achieving a balance between employability skills and laying the foundation for higher education. Generally, the curriculum is the combination of core technical subjects, professional electives, humanities, and skill-oriented subjects. We propose to use natural language processing and machine learning methods for generating useful insights in designing a curriculum.

## Platform to support SSLC and PUC Students in India (2020) 
*Supported by Hub for Good Program, DigitalOcean, USA \
Grant : $250 Cloud Credits \
Role: Principal Investigator* 

Description: Academically 10th (SSLC) and 12th (PUC-II) standards are considered milestone in studentsâ€™ life in India. Through our proposal we aim to provide support for the students of 10th and 12th standard students in India. We would like setup three softwares which will aid in improving the learning experience of the students. First we would like setup Moodle learning management system to host educational materials and conduct assessments. Second we will setup BigBlueButton conferencing software (also available as a pulg-in for Moodle software) which can be used to address the queries of the students, and counsel students in both academic and non-academic matters. Third, we would like to setup a Discourse platform as a discussion forum.  We would like to provide this solution free of cost to all the school students in India.
